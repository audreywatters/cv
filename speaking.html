<h2>Speaking Arrangements</h2>
<br />
<p>Thank you for considering me as a speaker for your event. My travel schedule is <a href="http://cv.audreywatters.com/travel.html">listed on my website</a>, so you can check my availability before you reach out to me. .</p>

<p>Please tell me in advance exactly what you&#8217;re expecting from me: How long should I speak? Are there other meetings you expect me to attend in addition to my lecture? (If so, please recognize that traveling and speaking are really exhausting, and I will need some down time.)</p>

<p>We will not need to get on the phone to plan my visit. I do this a lot; I know what I&#8217;m doing. We can talk about everything over email. I promise.</p>

<p>Some things I do like to know: is there a particular topic you&#8217;d like me to address? Are there particular issues &#8211; in your organization, on your campus &#8211; I should be aware of? Do you have a goal for my presence?</p>

<p>Please note that I can be a provocative speaker. You need to look for someone else if you aren&#8217;t interested in that. </p>

<p><strong>Speaking fees:</strong> I do not have a fixed speaking fee as I charge a different amount depending on the size of the audience, the location, the type of event, and so on. But listen: this is how I pay the rent. I cannot speak for free. When you think about what an appropriate fee might be, do recognize I write a new talk for each speaking engagement. An hour-long lecture is about 5000 words. So my fee should not just account for the hour I&#8217;ll spend at the podium. There are real costs for me to write a talk and, of course, to travel. Please be respectful of that.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> I really would prefer to use my own computer for the presentation. (I use a MacBook Air, and yes, I will bring a dongle.) I use Keynote for my slides, and I find converting to PowerPoint messes up the fonts and the layout. Rarely do I include video in my presentation, but I will let you know if I need to plug into the sound system. If you insist that I use a different computer during the presentation or that I give you slides in a different format, know that I will not be able to hand you these until the day I am speaking. (I won&#8217;t lie. I finish my talk the night before.)</p>

<p>It is usually fine with me if you want to record audio and/or video of my lecture or to livestream it. I retain all rights to my talk. I will publish a transcript on Hack Education afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Travel arrangements:</strong> I don&#8217;t mind making my own travel plans, but you expect me to do so, let me know how (and how quickly) I will be reimbursed. If you book the hotel, please choose one close to the speaking venue (or arrange transportation).</p>
