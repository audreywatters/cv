<h3>Writing</h3>
<br />
<p>I write. I've always written. I hate it, and I love it, and I wouldn't want to do anything else.</p>

<p>For over a decade, I wrote essays and analysis (and rants) about education technology on my site&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>. However, ed-tech is no longer my focus. I currently write about health tech, specifically food and fitness technologies (which unfortunately seem to share a lot of behaviorism and bullshit with ed-tech). My newsletter, <em><a href="http://2ndbreakfast.substack.com">Second Breakfast</a></em> is published three times a week and offers critical analysis, memoir, history, and breakfast recipes.</p>

<p>I do freelance from time-to-time, and my work has appeared in <a href="https://thebaffler.com/authors/audrey-watters">The Baffler</a>, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/audrey-watters/">The Atlantic</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/contributor/audrey-watters">Vice</a>, <a href="http://boundary2.org/">Boundary2</a>, <a href="http://kernelmag.dailydot.com">The Daily Dot</a>, <a href="http://medium.com/bright">Bright</a>, <a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/author/audrey-watters/">Hybrid Pedagogy</a>, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Radar</a>, <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/">KQED's MindShift</a>, <a href="http://insidehighered.com/">Inside Higher Ed</a>, <a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/author/awatters/">School Library Journal</a>, <a href="http://modernlearners.com">Educating Modern Learners</a>, <a href="http://readwriteweb.com/">ReadWriteWeb</a>, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/Home.aspx">Campus Technology</a>, <a href="http://huffingtonpost.com/">The Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://edutopia.org/">Edutopia</a>, and elsewhere across the Web. I've been a blogger on-and-off for the past fourteen years, blending the personal, the political, and the professional as I've written about school, learning, life, and death. Before that, I wrote <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fYilhFkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">academic essays</a> - some published, some not. (Few read, let's be honest.) Before that, poetry.</p>

<p>I'm the author of <em><a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> (2014), <em><a href="http://monsters2.hackeducation.com">The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> (2015), <em><a href="http://monsters3.hackeducation.com">The Curse of the Monsters of Education Technology</a></em> (2016), and <em><a href="http://monsters4.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology 4</a></em> (2017), collections of my keynotes and public talks. I also published <em><a href="http://reclaim.hackeducation.com">Claim Your Domain</a></em> in 2015, which argues students should control their digital identities and digital work. My most recent book, <em><a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a></em> (MIT Press), looks at the pre-digital history of personalized computing.</p>

<p>I was a Spencer Education Journalism Fellow at Columbia University's Journalism School for the 2017-2018 academic year.</p>

<h3>Speaking</h3>
<br />
<p>Freelance writing isn't terribly lucrative. Go figure. So to pay the bills, I speak. Or, I write lengthy essays, and then I read them out loud to an audience. You can read some of the transcripts <a href="http://speaking.audreywatters.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>My upcoming travel and speaking schedule is available <a href="http://cv.audreywatters.com/travel.html">here</a>. I'm happy to entertain speaking requests. My speaking fee is negotiable. (<a href="http://cv.audreywatters.com/speaking.html">Here are some things to keep in mind if you want me to speak at your event</a>.)</p>

<h3>Teaching</h3>
<br />
<p>I officially left the classroom (circa 2007) when I left graduate school. I've taught a handful of classes and workshops since. You can view a selection of <a href="http://teaching.audreywatters.com/">course materials here</a>. I am a certified personal trainer, and I have Level 1 Precision Nutrition certification as well.</p>

<p>I am willing to consider teaching and coaching gigs. Again, my fees are negotiable.</p>
